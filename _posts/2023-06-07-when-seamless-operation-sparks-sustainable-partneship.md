# NodeOPCUA: When Seamless Operation Sparks a Sustainable Partnership


### Great software

> Great software is like a best friend - always there, never causing any drama, and making life so much easier.

Let's face it, open-source technology is a marvel, especially when it works perfectly, integrates seamlessly with your application, and provides a user-friendly environment that drives astonishing performance. If you're a user of NodeOPCUA, you've probably experienced all of these benefits firsthand, making the choice to base your application on our middleware - a decision we are incredibly proud of.

One of the hallmarks of our work at NodeOPCUA is developing high-quality software. Our APIs are designed not to require complex technical support - which in fact, we count as our greatest success. We've committed ourselves to ensure that your experience with our software is smooth and efficient, and the fact that support calls are few and far between is testament to this commitment.

### Behind the scenes

However, behind this seamless user experience, our dedicated team is tirelessly working to constantly improve the technology. From refactoring the code to improving performance, to staying at the forefront of modern NodeJS and TypeScript technology, our focus is consistent and relentless. Our promise is to deliver an incremental release every two weeks on average, ensuring that your experience with NodeOPCUA only gets better over time.

But for this to continue, we need your support.

Your backing is not only about ensuring the continuity and enhancement of a product that you use. It is about joining hands with us in a partnership that aims for innovation and excellence. We want to engage with you in a stronger business relationship where you, too, have a stake in shaping the future of NodeOPCUA.

### The choice is yours

Ultimately, the choice to support NodeOPCUA is not just about buying a support contract for a technology that works seamlessly. It is about recognizing the effort that goes into maintaining that seamlessness, the hard work that makes sure the technology remains cutting-edge, and the diligence that keeps the innovation going.

Supporting NodeOPCUA is about sustainability. It's about protecting your investment, your applications, and ensuring their stability for the future. It's about creating a symbiotic relationship that ensures we can keep providing you with the service you've come to rely on.
